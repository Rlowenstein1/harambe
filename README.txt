Gameplay:
To play this game, download and open the .exe file. You will be brought to a start screen that displays a game menu
with options "Start Game" and "Exit." Clicking on "Start Game," the game will begin and the camera will zoom and focus
on our character Harambe the gorilla. The level objective is displayed in the top right of the screen, and can range
from having to destroy a certain number (1-3) of tanks, or reaching a specific point in the level to "escape the city."
On the top left is a red health bar, displaying how much health Harambe has left. To move Harambe we can use the 
W, A, S, D or up, left, down, right arrow keys to move him forward, or backwards, or rotate left or right. As we move
forwards, we can press the 1 key to have him speed up and start running rather than just walk. We can also press
the space bar to have him jump. Harambe also has an attack which can be triggered by pressing the ctrl key. Harambe is
able to attack the modeled buildings around him. To observe this behavior go to the building directly on the right
and press ctrl multiple times to have him destroy the building. As he continues to attack the building, the building
breaks apart and eventually gets destroyed completely. There are also tanks that spawn in different locations and
drive around the map trying to attack Harambe. The tanks will shoot at him and if he is hit, he will lose health
which can be observed from the health bar. Once his health runs out he will die and we can see this because he will
flop over and the user controls no longer work. The player is then brought to the game menu.
Harambe is able to attack the tanks as well by getting close enough
and pressing ctrl to attack them. Once their health runs out, the top pops off and the tank sinks. If the objective 
is to kill a certain amount of tanks and you succeed, the HUD will say "You Win!" and you will be taken back to the
game menu. At any point in the game if you need to pause, exit, or restart, simply press the escape key and the pause
menu will pause the game and display those options.
